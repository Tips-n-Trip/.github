# Welcome to the official repository of Tips n Trip
Tips n Trip is an app made by C23-PS483 students for Bangkit 2023 Capstone Project.
Tips n Trip is an application that can provide a holiday itinerary per day that contains tourism destinations, such as natural tourism, amusement parks, or culinary places, and also the right time to visit them for users based on the destination city, estimated budget, and duration of holiday they provide. In addition to providing vacation itineraries, the application can provide places or places to buy souvenirs in the area or city. This is motivated by the tourism potential that Indonesia has in each city. According to data from the Kemenparekraf website, they predict that during the Eid Mubarok holiday, there are 123.8 million people who go for holidays. However, people who want to travel to an area or city for the first time often spend too much time looking for tourist destinations in the city and making a budget plan, then include it in their holiday itinerary. This is a problem that can lose the huge economic potential, but can be solved by the use of technology. This is where the Tips n Trip application plays a crucial role in providing solutions to overcome these problems and increase the tourism potential of a region or city.
